# Task1
### CalculatorPlus.

I have developed a Python application called "CalculatorPlus." The application provides basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

**Step I**
 - I have created a repo named **git_assignment_HeroVired**
 - Under this repo created a ‘dev’ branch & implemented the basic arithmetic operations
 - Test it & release the first version i.e. version v1.0

**Step II**
  - Implemented the function to calculate the square root of a number.
  - First created a new branch feature/sqrt under 'dev'
  - Add the .py codes for sqrt feature & Test it & release the second version i.e. version v2.0

**Bug Fixed**
  - During the second step I found a bug in the divide function
  - Fixed that, test it again & pushed back with the correct codes.


# Task2
### Git_LFS
Implemented & Demonstrated how to use Large File Storage using **git lfs**

 - Installed Git LFS on our local machine.
   - git lfs install
 - Initialize Git LFS in the same Git repository.
   - git lfs init
 - Track the large binary files in our repository.
   - git lfs track my_large_file.bin
 - Add, commit, and push the binary files to the repository.
   - git add *.jpg
   - git commit -m "Added binary files"
   - git push
 - Clone the repository on another machine to verify that the binary files are downloaded correctly.


# Task3
### Geometry-Calculator
Implemented calculating circle area and calculating rectangle area

a.  Create a New Branch:
- Create a new branch named "feature/circle-area" to work on the circle-area feature

b.  Stash Changes for Circle Area Feature:
-  Before committing the changes, stash them using git stash to save the incomplete feature implementation.
-  Verify that the working directory is clean

c.  Create a New Branch for Rectangle Area Feature:
- Create a new branch named "feature/rectangle-area" to work on the rectangle area

d.  Stash Changes for Rectangle Area Feature:
-  Before committing the changes, stash them using git stash to save the incomplete feature implementation.
-  Verify that the working directory is clean

e.  Switch Back to Circle Area Branch:
-  Switch back to the "feature/circle-area" branch to continue working on the circle area feature.
-  Retrieve the stashed changes
-  Complete the circle area feature implementation and save the changes.

f.  Commit and Push Circle Area Feature:

g.  Switch Back to Rectangle Area Branch:
-  Switch back to the "feature/rectangle-area" branch to continue working on the rectangle area feature.
-  Retrieve the stashed changes
-  Complete the rectangle area feature implementation and save the changes.

h.  Commit and Push Rectangle Area Feature

i.  Create Pull Requests:
-    Create a pull request to the ‘dev’ branch.

j.  Review and Merge
-  Have another team member or reviewer review your pull requests.
-  After receiving approval, merge both pull requests into the main branch.
