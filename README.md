# Task1
### CalculatorPlus.

I have developed a Python application called "CalculatorPlus." The application provides basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

**Step I**
 - I have created a repo named **git_assignment_HeroVired**
 - Under this repo created a ‘dev’ branch & implemented the basic arithmetic operations
 - Test it & release the first version i.e. version v1.0

**Step II**
  - Implemented the function to calculate the square root of a number.
  - First created a new branch feature/sqrt under 'dev'
  - Add the .py codes for sqrt feature & Test it & release the second version i.e. version v2.0

**Bug Fixed**
  - During the second step I found a bug in the divide function
  - Fixed that, test it again & pushed back with the correct codes.


# Task2
### Git_LFS
Implemented & Demonstrated how to use Large File Storage using **git lfs**

 - Installed Git LFS on our local machine.
   - # git lfs install
 - Initialize Git LFS in the same Git repository.
   - # git lfs init
 - Track the large binary files in our repository.
   - # git lfs track my_large_file.bin
 - Add, commit, and push the binary files to the repository.
   - # git add *.jpg
   - # git commit -m "Added binary files"
   - # git push
 - Clone the repository on another machine to verify that the binary files are downloaded correctly.
