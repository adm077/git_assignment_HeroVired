# CalculatorPlus

I have developed a Python application called "CalculatorPlus." The application provides basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Task 1

Step I

I have created a repo named git_assignment_HeroVired
Under this repo, I created a 'dev' branch and implemented the basic arithmetic operations.
Tested it and released the first version i.e. version v1.0

Step II

Implemented the function to calculate the square root of a number.
First, I created a new branch `feature/sqrt` under 'dev'.
Added the .py codes for the sqrt feature and tested it.
Released the second version i.e. version v2.0

Bug Fixed

During the second step, I found a bug in the divide function.
Fixed that, tested it again, and pushed back with the correct codes.

## Task 2 - Git_LFS

Implemented & Demonstrated how to use Large File Storage using git lfs

- Installed Git LFS on our local machine.
git lfs install

- Initialized Git LFS in the same Git repository.
git lfs init

- Tracked the large binary files in our repository.
git lfs track my_large_file.bin

- Added, committed, and pushed the binary files to the repository.
git add *.bin
git commit -m "Added binary files"
git push
Cloned the repository on another machine to verify that the binary files are downloaded correctly.

## Task 3 - Geometry-Calculator

Implemented calculating circle area and calculating rectangle area

a. Create a New Branch
Created a new branch named "feature/circle-area" to work on the circle-area feature.

b. Stash Changes for Circle Area Feature
Before committing the changes, stashed them using git stash to save the incomplete feature implementation.
Verified that the working directory is clean.

c. Create a New Branch for Rectangle Area Feature
Created a new branch named "feature/rectangle-area" to work on the rectangle area.

d. Stash Changes for Rectangle Area Feature
Before committing the changes, stashed them using git stash to save the incomplete feature implementation.
Verified that the working directory is clean.

e. Switch Back to Circle Area Branch
Switched back to the "feature/circle-area" branch to continue working on the circle area feature.
Retrieved the stashed changes.
Completed the circle area feature implementation and saved the changes.

f. Commit and Push Circle Area Feature
g. Switch Back to Rectangle Area Branch
Switched back to the "feature/rectangle-area" branch to continue working on the rectangle area feature.
Retrieved the stashed changes.
Completed the rectangle area feature implementation and saved the changes.

h. Commit and Push Rectangle Area Feature
i. Create Pull Requests
Created pull requests to the 'dev' branch.

j. Review and Merge
Had another team member or reviewer review the pull requests.
After receiving approval, merged both pull requests into the main branch.
