# git_assignment_HeroVired
CalculatorPlus.

I have developed a Python application called "CalculatorPlus." The application provides basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

**Step I**
 - I have created a repo named **git_assignment_HeroVired**
 - Under this repo created a ‘dev’ branch & implemented the basic arithmetic operations
 - Test it & release the first version i.e. version v1.0

**Step II**
  - Implemented the function to calculate the square root of a number.
  - First created a new branch feature/sqrt under 'dev'
  - Add the .py codes for sqrt feature & Test it & release the second version i.e. version v2.0

**Bug Fixed**
  - During the second step I found a bug in the divide function
  - Fixed that, test it again & pushed back with the correct codes.
